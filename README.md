# Challenge-12-Redo Employee Organizer/Tracker

## Project Uses
This project was created with the purpose of making Employee Tracking more simple and organized than what can be possible on paper. It tracks employees by their title, department, name, and salaries within the business and allows for quick updates, seemless transitions between different selection options and simplistic design so that it is easier to use. I currently still have more updates to be done.
